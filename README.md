# ArtworkReverseSearch
A tool for searching the source of an artwork just by using the downloaded file name. You need to know where the file was downloaded first. Since this is searching with the filename or post id, unlike saucenao, it doesn't work with something like unknown.png or IMG_XXXX.png.
This was inspired after I accidentally corrupted my files. I only have the file name left with me.
## How to use
Simply download ReverseSearch.py and run it with any version of python3. It's just a single file.
